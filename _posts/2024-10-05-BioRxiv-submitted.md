Our manuscript, “Heterogeneity in chromatin structure drives core regulatory pathways in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,” is submitted to BioRxiv and Nature Genetics. In this work, Dr. Xu profiled over 50 primary pediatric B-ALL samples using Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq, and identified distinct 3D genome structures across transcriptional subtypes linked to B-cell developmental stages.
