Dr. Xiaolin Wei has started as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab. Xiaolin and Zhichao have been friends and colleagues for years, as they graduated from the same lab at Tsinghua University. Although trained in two different labs for postdoctoral research, Xiaolin and Zhichao were still in close connection and in the same field. As Xiaolin is actively searching for faculty positions, he is also helping Zhichao to set up his research programs here in Houston.
