Zhichao has received the NCI Transition Career Development Award (K22).  This grant will support research on investigating the role of trans-acting factors and cis-element sequences in oncogene activation in rearranged human genomes, with a central hypothesis that quantitative oncogene expression modeling should include the variable binding of trans-acting factors and promoter sequences.
