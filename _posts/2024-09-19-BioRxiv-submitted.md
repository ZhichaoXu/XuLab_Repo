Our manuscript, “A STAG2-PAXIP1/PAGR1 axis suppresses lung tumorigenesis,” is submitted to BioRxiv and the Journal of Experimental Medicine. In collaboration with Dr. Monte Winslow at Stanford, this work uncovered the function of STAG2 in a mouse lung cancer model. Dr. Xu contributed to the genome conformation profiling and data analysis, and was responsible for writing and preparing the figures for this section of the manuscript.
