The previous Biorxiv paper titled “A STAG2-PAXIP1/PAGR1 axis suppresses lung tumorigenesis” is accepted at the Journal of Experimental Medicine. In collaboration with Dr. Monte Winslow at Stanford, this work uncovered the function of STAG2 in a mouse lung cancer model. Dr. Xu contributed to the genome conformation profiling and data analysis, and was responsible for writing and preparing the figures for this section of the manuscript.
