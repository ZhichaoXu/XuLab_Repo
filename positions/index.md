# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-hands-helping" %}Join us

Our goal is to build a lab rooted in diversity. Scientifically, we will integrate our strengths in wet lab experiments with cutting-edge computational genomics. Culturally, we are committed to fostering an inclusive environment that values the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of all members. Looking ahead, we will support the growth of compassionate trainees and scientists, acknowledging their unique career development needs.

# Ongoing Opportunities

### Staff Positions
Up to two research assistant positions are available for both junior and senior ranks. For junior technicians, those considering graduate programs in genetics and genomics, and looking to begin their training early as graduate students, are encouraged to apply. We also welcome experienced technicians interested in helping to set up and run a new laboratory.

### Postdoctoral scholars
We are excited to offer up to two postdoctoral positions in two distinct directions. For both roles, we welcome motivated, responsible scientists who have recently obtained their PhD in relevant fields and enjoy working in a collaborative team environment. If you’re passionate about making an impact in cancer genetics and genomics, we’d love to hear from you!
1. **Postdoctoral fellow in cancer genetics and genome engineering:** This wet-lab position focuses on developing cancer cell line models by replicating the complex genome rearrangements observed in human cancers. The role will involve applying complex genome engineering to accurately mimic these rearrangements and study their biological consequences. Strong experience in genome engineering, synthetic biology, and single-cell sequencing is highly preferred.
2. **Postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics:** This hybrid position focuses on developing innovative genomic technologies to uncover new principles in gene regulation. The role involves conducting high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screens in cell lines to systematically perturb gene regulation pathways. Strong experience with Perturb-seq, multi-omic sequencing techniques, and the development of customized data analysis pipelines is highly preferred. Familiarity with advanced bioinformatics tools and the integration of diverse genomic datasets will be an added advantage.

### Graduate students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 
<br>
<br>
Genetics and Epigenetics
<br>
<br>
Cancer Biology
<br>
<br>

### Undergraduate students
Our lab is open to motivated undergraduate students who would like to do summer/winter internship or work on undergraduate thesis projects.
