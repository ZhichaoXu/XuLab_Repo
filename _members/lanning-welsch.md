Lanning Welsch is currently a Research Assistant in Dr. Xu’s laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She holds a B.S. in Computational Biology from the University of Texas at Austin and plans to pursue a graduate degree in Bioinformatics.

Lanning’s primary research interests focus on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying cancer and the development of novel computational approaches to address related biological questions. In Dr.Xu’s lab, she is currently investigating the regulatory mechanisms between distal enhancers and their target genes (you can change this if I misinterpreted!!!).

In her free time, Lanning enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, swimming, and trail running. She also loves spending quality time with her friends, family, and her cat, Mako.
