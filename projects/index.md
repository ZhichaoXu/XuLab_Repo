{% capture text %} We aim to develop a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based method to generate a large number of translocations near the oncogenes of interest in cell lines. Utilizing single-cell multi-omics sequencing, we will simultaneously measure oncogene expression near the SVs and profile local genome conformation. Based on the single-cell sequencing data, we aim to train computational models integrating enhancers to predict oncogene expression near SVs. Successful completion of this aim will first identify risky partner regions genome-wide for certain oncogenes, then integrate that into oncogene expression prediction models.
